        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A bike rental system typically consists of a network of rental stations where customers can rent bicycles for short periods of time, usually for a few hours or a day. These systems are popular in urban areas and tourist destinations as a convenient and eco-friendly transportation option. Here's a detailed description of a typical bike rental system:
            Rental Stations: There are multiple rental stations strategically located throughout the city or area of operation. Each station has a designated number of bicycles available for rent.
            Bicycle Availability: Customers can check the availability of bicycles at each station through various means, such as mobile apps, websites, or physical signage at the station.
            Rental Process: To rent a bicycle, customers typically need to register with the system. This registration can often be done online or via a mobile app, where users provide their payment information and agree to terms of service.
            Payment Options: Payment for bike rentals is usually done electronically through the app or website. Customers may pay per ride or purchase a subscription that allows unlimited rides within a certain time period.
            Unlocking Bicycles: Once payment is confirmed, customers receive a code or use their app to unlock a bicycle from its docking station. Some systems use RFID cards or other electronic keys for this purpose.
            Usage Period: Customers can use the rented bicycle for a specified period of time, often charged by the hour. The bicycles are designed for short trips around the city and are equipped with features like adjustable seats, baskets, and lights.
            Return Process: After use, customers return the bicycle to any designated station within the system's network. The bike is securely docked at the station to complete the rental transaction.
            Maintenance and Operations: The rental system operator is responsible for maintaining the bicycles, ensuring they are in good working condition, and managing the logistics of redistributing bikes across stations to maintain availability.
            Customer Support: The system typically offers customer support through its app, website, or a dedicated hotline to assist with issues such as payment problems, bike malfunctions, or lost/stolen bikes.
            Benefits: Bike rental systems promote sustainable urban mobility by reducing car dependency, alleviating traffic congestion, and lowering carbon emissions. They also provide tourists and residents with an affordable and healthy transportation option.
